{"body":"## DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThis is a simple JavaScript/CSS component that enables you to do Horizontal Pagination on a HTML website.\r\nPanes can be scrolled left or right smoothly as if on a continuous reel. Panes are simply defined by using the 'pane' CSS class.\r\n\r\n## USAGE\r\n\r\nYou'll need to have div to contain the panes and give it the CSS class 'pane-container'. You can then add panes inside the container,\r\nwhich must have the CSS class 'pane':\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"pane-container\">\r\n        <div class=\"pane\"...>\r\n        <div class=\"pane\"...>\r\n        <div class=\"pane\"...>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nYou also need to create the HPage JavaScript object. It works with jQuery so you'll need to do something like this:\r\n\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n        var hPage = undefined;\r\n\r\n        $(document).ready(function () {\r\n            hPage = new HPage({size:$('.pane').size()});\r\n            hPage.start();\r\n        });\r\n    </script>\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","google":"","name":"Horizontalpaginate","tagline":"Horizontal Pagination JS lib"}
